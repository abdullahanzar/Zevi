## Issues

Faker API has been used to fetch details of different products as was required by the project. As many of the functionalities of **Faker API have been depreciated and no longer maintained**,
there can be **issues** of **inconsistent or incorrect products, their names, images, etc.** My apologies for this but you may clone and replace the API calls with your own to resolve these inconsistencies.
